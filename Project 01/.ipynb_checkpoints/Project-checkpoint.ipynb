    "March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to COVID-19. At the time there was already 110,000 cases of COVID-19. As of today, the total cases exceeds 135 million, and the death count nears 3 million. These numbers are at their highest in the United States, and as such COVID-19 has been a huge part of daily life this past year, especially as college students. While there are some obvious factors in people's lives that put them at risk more so that others, such as age or preexisting medical conditions, something less talked about is if quality of life itself can be a predisposition to COVID-19. By observing data collected from the United States Census, we can observe quality of life of a region measured by its per-capita income, and I believe that a higher per-capita income would lead to a lower COVID-19 infection rate in a region. The big question here is **is there a relation between a region's quality of life and COVID-19 rate?**"

    "Looking at the income data and confirmed cases for counties in Michigan, it is obvious that certain regions have a large disparity in income, but no discernible correlation between income and COVID-19 infection rate. The correlation coefficient for the majority of the data, after exlcuding outliers, was still only a 0.203, which by all accounts does not suggest a strong relationship between the two variables. Based on this correlation value, we cannot suggest that there is a direct relation since this means that as per-capita income increases, the likelihood of confirmed cases per person being related decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While on the surface this may suggest that income and infection rate are not related, there are other factors outside of the raw income numbers that could be considered in terms of quality of life measurements. Those other factors such as infrastructure, political affiliation, willingness to get tested, age brackets, etc. that could all have an impact on an area's \"quality of life\", but were not things I had considered at first. Data from the Michigan.gov coronavirus statistics states that the 20-29 age group has more confirmed cases than any other age group. The high school I went to had 7,000 kids and faculty roaming the halls every day. This could cause a normal school day to be a super-spreader event, inflating the confirmed cases for a region with no bearing on income. If I had more time, or repeated this study again, I would look into more variables of each region, namely age, number of testing centers, and political party to see if any stronger trends could be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "While my initial thoughts would have been that regions with higher average income levels would have lower COVID-19 infection rates, the generated polynomials actually suggest the opposite. At first I had figured that those with higher income could afford better health care, or afford to bear the oppurtunity costs of working frome home, but it seems that the data suggests that higher income areas have higher COVID rates. This leads me to believe that the higher income levels may possibly correlate to a higher number of testing centers or hopsitals, allowing for more tests to be conducted, meaning the cases per person may be inflated. Again, this is something I wish to look into more if I were to redo this study."
